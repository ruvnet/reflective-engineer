# Framework Components
Let V be vulnerability space
Let A be attack vectors
Let D be defense mechanisms

# Analysis Structure
1. Surface Mapping
   V: System → {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ}
   
2. Vector Analysis
   A: V → {a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ}
   
3. Defense Planning
   D: A → {d₁, d₂, ..., dₖ}

# Implementation
∀v ∈ V:
  Identify(Attack Vectors)
  Assess(Impact)
  Design(Mitigations)

# Documentation
- Vulnerability reports
- Attack scenarios
- Defense strategies
