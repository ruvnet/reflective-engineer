# Optimization Space
Let T be token set
Let C be context window
Let E be efficiency function

# Core Techniques
1. Token Reduction
   min(|T|) subject to:
   - Meaning preservation
   - Context retention
   - Clarity maintenance

2. Context Management
   C = {t âˆˆ T | Relevant(t)}
   
3. Efficiency Metrics
   E(T) = Quality/TokenCount

# Implementation
- Token counting
- Compression strategies
- Context pruning
- Format optimization
