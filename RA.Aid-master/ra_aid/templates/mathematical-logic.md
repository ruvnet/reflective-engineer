# Sets and Axioms
Let A be the set of all logical propositions.
Let T be the subset of A that are tautologies.
Let C be the subset of A that are contradictions.

# Predicates
P(x): "x is a well-formed formula"
Q(x): "x is satisfiable"
R(x): "x is valid"

# Objectives
1. Prove completeness theorem using predicate calculus
2. Demonstrate soundness of the system
3. Show relationship between syntax and semantics---
