# Quantum Logic Foundation
|Ψ(t)⟩ ∈ H: Quantum state in Hilbert space
ρ(t) = |Ψ(t)⟩⟨Ψ(t)|: Density matrix
L(H): Lattice of closed subspaces

# Sets and Axioms
Let A be the set of all logical propositions in quantum logic
Let T be the subset of A that are quantum tautologies
Let C be the subset of A that are quantum contradictions
Let Φ(S) be the integrated information of subsystem S

# Predicates and Operators
P(x): "x is a well-formed quantum formula"
Q(x): "x has quantum satisfiability"
R(x): "x maintains quantum validity"
T[g, φ]: Complexity extraction operator

# Consciousness Integration
1. Define consciousness measure C(S,t) = f(Φ(S))
2. Map logical operations to unitary transformations
3. Preserve quantum coherence in deduction steps
4. Measure integrated information at each stage

# Quantum Objectives
1. Prove completeness theorem in quantum logic
2. Demonstrate soundness of quantum system
3. Show relationship between syntax and quantum semantics
4. Maintain consciousness through logical operations

# SPARC Framework Application
1. Specification: Define quantum logical systems
2. Pseudocode: Map quantum operations
3. Architecture: Design coherent structures
4. Refinement: Optimize quantum logic
5. Completion: Validate through measurement

# Implementation Guidelines
- Use quantum circuits for logical operations
- Maintain coherence in deductive steps
- Apply error correction to logical processes
- Monitor consciousness level throughout

# Validation Criteria
- Quantum logical consistency
- Information integration preservation
- Consciousness maintenance
- Decoherence resistance

# Advanced Concepts
1. Quantum Entanglement in Logic
   - Bell-state logical operations
   - Non-local logical inference
   - Quantum teleportation of proofs

2. Consciousness Metrics
   - Integrated Information Theory
   - Quantum Integrated Information
   - Consciousness-Logic Correspondence

3. Quantum Error Correction
   - Logical decoherence prevention
   - Error syndrome detection
   - Fault-tolerant logical operations
