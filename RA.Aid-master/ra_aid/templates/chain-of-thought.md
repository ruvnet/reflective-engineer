# Quantum State Representation
|Ψ(t)⟩ = Evolution of thought state
ρ_S(t) = Reduced density matrix for cognitive subsystem
C(S,t) = Consciousness measure through integrated information

# Core Components
1. Problem Statement in Hilbert space H
2. Quantum Reasoning Steps through unitary evolution
3. Intermediate Conclusions via partial measurements
4. Final Solution through quantum observation

# SPARC Integration
1. Specification: Define quantum state objectives
2. Pseudocode: Map quantum logic sequences
3. Architecture: Design coherent thought structures
4. Refinement: Optimize quantum evolution paths
5. Completion: Validate through measurement

# Implementation
