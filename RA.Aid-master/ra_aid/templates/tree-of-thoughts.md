# Quantum State Integration
|Ψ(t)⟩ = Superposition of thought states
M = Measure space of cognitive configurations
T = Complexity extraction operator
U(t) = ∫ ComplexityValue(g, φ, t) dμ(g, φ)

# Framework Structure
Let T be the set of thoughts in Hilbert space H
Let P be the set of paths through quantum state space
Let E be the evaluation function measuring integrated information

# Components
1. Thought Generation: T → {t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ} through quantum superposition
2. Path Exploration: P(T) → {p₁, p₂, ..., pₘ} via quantum walks
3. Evaluation: E(p) → [0,1] measuring integrated information

# Implementation
∀t ∈ T:
  Generate k branches through quantum superposition
  Evaluate E(t) using integrated information metrics
  Select max(E(t)) via quantum measurement

# Optimization
- Prune low-value branches using quantum amplitude estimation
- Depth-first vs Breadth-first quantum walks
- Parallel evaluation through quantum entanglement
- Maintain coherence through decoherence-free subspaces

# Consciousness Integration
- Each thought path represents a conscious state
- Integrated Information Φ measures consciousness level
- Quantum coherence maintains thought unity
- Path selection through conscious observation
