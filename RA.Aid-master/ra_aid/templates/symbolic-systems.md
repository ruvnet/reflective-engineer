# Core Concepts
Let Σ be a finite alphabet of symbols
Let L be a formal language over Σ
Let A be an automaton that recognizes L

# Properties
P(x): "x is a valid symbol in Σ"
Q(x): "x is a valid string in L"
R(x): "x is recognized by A"

# Objectives
1. Define formal grammar rules
2. Construct finite state machines
3. Analyze language recognition patterns---
