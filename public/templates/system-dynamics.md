# Sets and Categories
Let U be the universal set of actions within a system
Let S be the subset of U representing structural changes
Let E be the subset of U representing environmental impacts
Let R be the subset of actions related to response patterns

# Predicates
P(x): "Action x affects system structure"
Q(x): "Action x influences environment"
T(x): "Action x generates response patterns"

# Composition
g = g₁ ∘ g₂ ∘ g₃, where:
- g₁ ∈ S
- g₂ ∈ E
- g₃ ∈ R

# Objectives
1. Prove P(g₁) ∧ Q(g₂) ∧ T(g₃) are true
2. Show g satisfies O(g): system stability under composition
3. Model as group structure G with composition operation ∘
