# Structures
Let G be a group with operation •
Let H be a subgroup of G
Let N be a normal subgroup of G

# Properties
P(x): "x is a homomorphism"
Q(x): "x preserves group structure"
R(x): "x maps to kernel"

# Objectives
1. Prove fundamental homomorphism theorem
2. Show group action properties
3. Analyze quotient groups---
