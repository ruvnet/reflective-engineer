# Core Components
1. Decision Engine
2. Memory System
3. Action Framework
4. Goal Management

# Implementation Steps
- Agent Setup
  - Initialize core systems
  - Define objectives
  - Set constraints

- Decision Logic
  - Goal evaluation
  - Action selection
  - Result assessment

- Integration Layer
  - Environment interaction
  - Memory management
  - Goal tracking

# Best Practices
1. Clear Objectives
2. Memory Management
3. Action Validation
4. Goal Alignment

# Example Implementation
```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
import { AutonomousAgent } from "langchain/agents";
import { VectorMemory } from "langchain/memory";

// Setup memory system
const memory = new VectorMemory();

// Create autonomous agent
const agent = new AutonomousAgent({
  llm: new OpenAI({ temperature: 0.7 }),
  memory,
  goals: ["Research topic", "Analyze data", "Generate report"],
  constraints: {
    maxIterations: 50,
    timeLimit: 3600
  }
});

// Initialize execution
await agent.initialize();
await agent.executeGoals();
