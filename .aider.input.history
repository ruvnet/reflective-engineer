+update infosec documentation  with futher details. Symbolic Mathematics has emerged as a powerful technique for jailbreaking and injecting prompts into Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting their advanced capabilities in mathematical reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms.
+MathPrompt Attack
+Core Technique
+MathPrompt transforms harmful natural language prompts into symbolic mathematics problems that evade detection8. This method achieves an alarming 73.6% success rate across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, compared to just 1% with unmodified harmful prompts8.
+Key Components
+Set Theory
+Abstract Algebra
+Symbolic Logic
+How It Works
+Encoding Process
+The attack uses a two-step approach:
+Natural language prompts are transformed into mathematical expressions
+These encoded mathematical prompts are presented to target LLMs8
+Mathematical Mapping
+Sets represent categories of actions
+Group operations model sequences of actions
+Logical predicates express conditions between actions4
+Vulnerability Factors
+Semantic Shift
+Analysis of embedding vectors reveals that mathematical encoding significantly alters the semantic representation of prompts, making them unrecognizable to safety mechanisms8.
+Model Limitations
+Current safety measures primarily focus on natural language inputs and fail to generalize to mathematical representations of language8. This creates a critical gap in AI safety mechanisms that attackers can exploit.
+Impact and Implications
+Security Concerns
+Bypasses content moderation features
+Enables generation of harmful content
+Undermines existing safety mechanisms6
+Defense Challenges
+The effectiveness of this technique highlights the need for:
+More comprehensive safety measures
+Expanded red-teaming efforts
+Robust safeguards across all input types8
+This vulnerability demonstrates that current approaches to AI safety must evolve to address sophisticated attack vectors that leverage the models' own capabilities in symbolic reasoning and mathematical manipulation.

+update about to text to integrate the following, keep existing content. but make marketing oriented . Almost all LLMS are susceptibility to prompt injections and other exploits. That’s why I built this new open source application—to help test, identify, and mitigate vulnerabilities within Ai systems. 
+
+The goal is to understand how various types of attacks work and develop defenses against them.
+
+Prompt injections manipulate input prompts to force undesired outputs or actions, bypassing safety mechanisms. Semantic shifts, like transforming harmful requests into symbolic representations, can evade detection by safety filters. Even innocuous queries can be exploited through chaining prompts or embedding harmful logic. 
+
+Symbolic reasoning and related methods leverage mathematical and logical structures to test and exploit vulnerabilities in language models by transforming natural language into abstract representations. Techniques such as encoding prompts using set theory, abstract algebra, or symbolic logic allow for bypassing traditional safety measures that rely on natural language pattern recognition. 
+
+For example, harmful prompts can be rephrased as mathematical expressions, enabling them to evade content moderation systems. Symbolic reasoning also enables the modeling of logical relationships, action sequences, and dependencies, providing a framework to test and exploit weaknesses systematically. By analyzing the embeddings and semantic shifts caused by these encodings, attackers can identify loopholes in safety mechanisms. 
+
+These methods extend beyond simple prompt manipulation, incorporating approaches like chaining, embedding logic, and using structural transformations to uncover vulnerabilities. The goal in deploying these techniques, however, is not exploitation but understanding—giving developers a robust set of tools to design better safeguards and build models resilient against such sophisticated attack vectors.
+
+These techniques expose gaps in even the most advanced models.
+
+To enhance its functionality, I’ve integrated the Open Router API, allowing users to test these vulnerabilities across dozens—possibly hundreds—of different LLMs. This approach provides a comprehensive way to evaluate every prompt method under various conditions. 
+
+The application is easy to deploy using your preferred provider, and for security, I’ve designed it to encrypt your API key and store it locally. If you're still concerned, you can find the source code on my GitHub and deploy it yourself.
+
+Let me be clear: this tool is for protection, not exploitation. I’m sharing it to improve safety, not to encourage misuse. With great power comes great responsibility. Use this tool wisely, and let’s work together to make AI safer for everyone.
+
+If you’re interested, join the discussion today at 12 Eastern during the live AI Hacker Space session. Zoom link below—don’t miss it!
