# Category Theory Template

This template provides a framework for applying category theoretical concepts to problem-solving.

## Core Concepts

- Objects and Morphisms
- Functors and Natural Transformations
- Universal Properties
- Limits and Colimits

## Application Guidelines

1. Identify relevant categories
2. Map problem components to categorical structures
3. Apply universal constructions
4. Leverage categorical properties for solutions

## Integration Points

- Use with other mathematical frameworks
- Apply to code architecture
- Structure data relationships
