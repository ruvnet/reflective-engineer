# Mathematical Logic Template

This template provides a framework for applying formal logical reasoning to problem-solving.

## Core Concepts

- Propositional Logic
- First-Order Logic
- Proof Theory
- Model Theory

## Application Guidelines

1. Formalize problem statements
2. Apply logical inference rules
3. Construct formal proofs
4. Validate solutions

## Integration Points

- Use with formal verification
- Apply to code correctness
- Structure logical relationships
