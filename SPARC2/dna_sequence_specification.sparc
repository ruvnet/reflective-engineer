% Sorts and Constants
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Basic domain: Nucleotides and Sequence Length
sort nucleotide { a, c, g, t }.

% Specify the length of the DNA sequence to analyze.
constant length = N.  % N is an integer defining sequence length.
sort position {1..length}.

% A codon is a triple of nucleotides.
% We'll represent codons as integers referencing positions (e.g., (p,p+1,p+2)).
% For simplicity, codons occur only if p+2 <= length.
% The specification will rely on known mappings from codons to amino acids.

% If known amino acids are needed:
sort amino_acid { phe, leu, ile, met, val, ser, pro, thr, ala,
                  tyr, his, gln, asn, lys, asp, glu, cys, trp,
                  arg, gly, stop }.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Predicates - Input/Output
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% observed(P, Nuc) states the observed nucleotide Nuc at position P in the given DNA sequence.
predicate observed(position, nucleotide).

% reference(P, Nuc) states the expected (reference) nucleotide Nuc at position P (e.g., from a reference genome).
predicate reference(position, nucleotide).

% known_codon(X,Y,Z,AA) states that the codon formed by nucleotides X,Y,Z encodes amino_acid AA.
predicate known_codon(nucleotide, nucleotide, nucleotide, amino_acid).

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Derived Predicates and Intermediate Reasoning
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% codon_start(P) states that a codon starts at position P.
% A codon is valid only if P+2 ≤ length.
predicate codon_start(position).

% identified_codon(P,AA) states that at position P, we have identified a codon encoding amino_acid AA.
predicate identified_codon(position, amino_acid).

% mutation(P) states that position P is mutated compared to the reference sequence.
predicate mutation(position).

% complementary_pair(X,Y) states that nucleotides X and Y are complementary.
predicate complementary_pair(nucleotide, nucleotide).

% invalid_codon(P) states that the codon starting at P is not recognized or valid.
predicate invalid_codon(position).

% sequence_consistent states that the overall sequence interpretation is consistent.
predicate sequence_consistent.

% validated states that results have passed the validation checks.
predicate validated.

% issues_found states that some inconsistency or error was detected.
predicate issues_found.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Basic Rules
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Complementary base pairing rules:
complementary_pair(a,t).
complementary_pair(t,a).
complementary_pair(c,g).
complementary_pair(g,c).

% A codon start is any position P where P+2 <= length:
codon_start(P) :- position(P), P+2 <= length.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Identifying Codons
% To identify a codon at position P, we look at observed nucleotides at P, P+1, P+2.
% If known_codon maps (N1,N2,N3) to an amino_acid AA, and observed(P,N1), observed(P+1,N2), observed(P+2,N3),
% we can infer identified_codon(P, AA).

identified_codon(P, AA) :-
    codon_start(P),
    observed(P, N1), observed(P+1, N2), observed(P+2, N3),
    known_codon(N1, N2, N3, AA),
    AA != stop.

% Special case: If codon corresponds to a stop codon:
% We can handle it by allowing identified_codon(P, stop) if known_codon maps to stop.
identified_codon(P, stop) :-
    codon_start(P),
    observed(P, N1), observed(P+1, N2), observed(P+2, N3),
    known_codon(N1, N2, N3, stop).


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Mutation Detection
% A position P is mutated if observed(P,X) differs from reference(P,Y) and X != Y.
mutation(P) :- observed(P, X), reference(P, Y), X != Y.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Invalid Codons
% A codon is invalid if we cannot map the three nucleotides at (P,P+1,P+2) to any known amino_acid.
invalid_codon(P) :-
    codon_start(P),
    observed(P, N1), observed(P+1, N2), observed(P+2, N3),
    not known_codon(N1,N2,N3,_).


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Ensuring Sequence Consistency
% The sequence is consistent if:
% 1. No invalid codons appear in coding regions (if coding region is assumed entire sequence or a subset).
% 2. All positions have observed nucleotides.
% 3. Complementary checks (if we consider a double-stranded model) might be enforced.
% 4. No contradictory inference rules are triggered.
%
% For simplicity, let’s say sequence_consistent holds if:
% - There are no invalid_codon facts derived.
% - Every position is observed.
% Positions are guaranteed to be observed (in realistic scenario input must ensure this).
% If invalid codons exist, we must not conclude sequence_consistent.

% If any invalid_codon exists, deny sequence_consistent:
:- invalid_codon(_), sequence_consistent.

% If we assume every position must be observed:
:- position(P), not observed(P,_).

% If no invalid codons are present and every position is observed, we can allow sequence_consistent to be true.
sequence_consistent :- not invalid_codon(_).


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Validation Mechanism
% Validation involves checking inference accuracy:
% For now, we say validated holds if sequence_consistent holds and no contradictory conditions occur.
% If issues_found is never derived, we can conclude validated.

% Introduce conditions that would cause issues_found:
% For example, if a codon was identified that doesn't match what known_codon states or any contradictory scenario.
% We'll assume no contradictions if the rules above are respected.
% If at some point we want to detect a contradiction:
% A contradiction might be that identified_codon(P,AA) is derived but invalid_codon(P) also holds.
:- identified_codon(P,_), invalid_codon(P).

% If such a contradiction arises, we consider that issues_found:
issues_found :- identified_codon(P,_), invalid_codon(P).

% If issues_found is never derived, we can consider validated true.
validated :- sequence_consistent, not issues_found.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
% Example Output and Display
% We want to see which positions are mutated, which codons were identified, and if validated is true.
#show identified_codon/2.
#show mutation/1.
#show sequence_consistent/0.
#show validated/0.
#show issues_found/0.

% Input to the solver:
% Users would provide facts like:
% observed(1,a). observed(2,t). observed(3,g). ... observed(N, c).
% reference(1,a). reference(2,t). reference(3,a). ... (some reference data)
% known_codon(a,t,g,met). known_codon(t,a,a,stop). etc.

% The solver’s answer sets will reflect a consistent interpretation of the DNA sequence,
% identify codons, detect mutations, and decide whether the result is validated.
