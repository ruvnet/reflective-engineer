// Completion for DNA Sequence Analysis

// 1. Testing:
//    - Unit Tests:
//      - Test isComplementary function with valid and invalid nucleotide pairs
//      - Test identifyCodon function with valid and invalid codons
//      - Test isMutation function with mutated and non-mutated positions
//      - Test validateSequence function with consistent and inconsistent sequences
//    - Integration Tests:
//      - Test the entire sequence analysis process with various DNA sequences
//      - Test with different reference sequences
//      - Test with different known codon mappings
//      - Test with sequences containing mutations
//      - Test with sequences containing invalid codons
//    - Edge Cases:
//      - Test with empty sequences
//      - Test with very long sequences
//      - Test with sequences containing only one type of nucleotide
//      - Test with sequences containing invalid characters
//      - Test with invalid codon mappings
//    - Performance Tests:
//      - Test the performance of the analysis process with large sequences
//      - Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize code

// 2. Documentation:
//    - Provide clear documentation for all functions and components
//    - Document the input and output formats
//    - Document the assumptions and limitations of the analysis process
//    - Provide examples of how to use the analysis process
//    - Document the testing process and results

// 3. Deployment:
//    - Package the analysis process into a reusable component or library
//    - Provide instructions for how to install and use the component or library
//    - Provide options for different deployment environments (e.g., local, cloud)
//    - Ensure the component or library is compatible with different operating systems

// 4. Continuous Integration:
//    - Set up a continuous integration pipeline to automatically build and test the code
//    - Integrate with a version control system (e.g., Git)
//    - Automatically run tests on every code commit
//    - Automatically deploy the code to a staging environment
//    - Monitor the performance of the analysis process in the staging environment

// 5. Integration:
//    - Integrate the analysis process with other systems or tools
//    - Provide APIs for other systems to access the analysis process
//    - Ensure the analysis process is compatible with other systems
//    - Monitor the performance of the analysis process in the integrated environment

// 6. Maintenance:
//    - Regularly review and update the code
//    - Fix any bugs or issues that are reported
//    - Add new features or functionality as needed
//    - Monitor the performance of the analysis process
//    - Ensure the analysis process remains compatible with other systems
