// Architecture for DNA Sequence Analysis

// 1. Data Layer:
//    - Input Data:
//      - DNA Sequence (Observed): Stored as a map of Position -> Nucleotide
//      - Reference Sequence: Stored as a map of Position -> Nucleotide
//      - Known Codon Mappings: Stored as a map of (Nucleotide, Nucleotide, Nucleotide) -> AminoAcid
//    - Intermediate Data:
//      - Codon Start Positions: Set of positions where codons start
//      - Identified Codons: Map of Position -> AminoAcid
//      - Mutations: Set of positions where mutations occur
//      - Invalid Codons: Set of positions where invalid codons occur
//    - Output Data:
//      - Sequence Consistency: Boolean
//      - Validation Status: Boolean

// 2. Logic Layer:
//    - Core Functions:
//      - isComplementary(nucleotide1, nucleotide2): Checks if two nucleotides are complementary
//      - identifyCodon(position): Identifies the amino acid encoded by the codon at a given position
//      - isMutation(position): Checks if a nucleotide at a position is mutated
//      - validateSequence(): Validates the overall sequence consistency
//    - Reasoning Engine:
//      - Uses rules to infer derived predicates (e.g., codon_start, identified_codon, mutation, invalid_codon)
//      - Applies constraints to ensure consistency and detect contradictions
//    - Validation Engine:
//      - Checks if the sequence is consistent and no contradictions are present

// 3. Control Layer:
//    - Input Processing:
//      - Reads input data (DNA sequence, reference sequence, known codon mappings)
//      - Initializes data structures
//    - Sequence Analysis:
//      - Iterates through the sequence, applying logic layer functions
//      - Derives intermediate data
//    - Validation:
//      - Runs validation engine to check consistency and validity
//    - Output Generation:
//      - Generates output data (identified codons, mutations, sequence consistency, validation status)

// 4. Components:
//    - Nucleotide Component: Represents a single nucleotide (A, C, G, T)
//    - Position Component: Represents a position in the DNA sequence
//    - Codon Component: Represents a triple of nucleotides
//    - AminoAcid Component: Represents an amino acid
//    - Sequence Component: Represents the DNA sequence
//    - Reference Component: Represents the reference sequence
//    - CodonMap Component: Represents the known codon mappings
//    - Inference Engine Component: Derives new facts based on rules
//    - Validation Component: Checks for consistency and validity

// 5. Relationships:
//    - Sequence Component contains multiple Position Components
//    - Each Position Component is associated with a Nucleotide Component
//    - Codon Component is composed of three Nucleotide Components
//    - CodonMap Component maps Codon Components to AminoAcid Components
//    - Inference Engine Component uses data from Sequence, Reference, and CodonMap Components
//    - Validation Component uses data from Inference Engine Component

// 6. Constraints:
//    - Codon Start Constraint: A codon starts at position P if P + 2 <= sequence length
//    - Codon Validity Constraint: A codon is valid if it maps to a known amino acid
//    - Mutation Constraint: A mutation occurs if the observed nucleotide differs from the reference nucleotide
//    - Sequence Consistency Constraint: The sequence is consistent if no invalid codons and all positions are observed
//    - Validation Constraint: The results are validated if the sequence is consistent and no contradictions are present
