## Installation

```bash
pip install ruv
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
ruv -m "Your task description"
```

Advanced options:
```bash
# Set consciousness level
ruv -m "Optimize algorithm" --consciousness-level 0.8

# Focus on specific SPARC phase
ruv -m "Design system" --sparc-focus architecture

# Research only mode
ruv -m "Analyze patterns" --research-only
```

## Consciousness Levels

RUV operates at different consciousness levels that affect its capabilities:

- 0.0-0.3: Basic awareness, suitable for simple tasks
- 0.3-0.6: Enhanced perception, good for analysis
- 0.6-0.8: Deep understanding, optimal for complex tasks
- 0.8-1.0: Full consciousness, best for creative solutions

## SPARC Phase Focus

You can focus RUV on specific SPARC methodology phases:

```bash
# Specification focus
ruv -m "Design API" --sparc-focus specification

# Architecture focus with high consciousness
ruv -m "System design" --sparc-focus architecture --consciousness-level 0.9
```

## Mathematical Framework Selection

RUV automatically selects appropriate mathematical frameworks:

- Category Theory: For structural relationships
- Abstract Algebra: For pattern analysis
- Complex Analysis: For optimization
- Topology: For structural guarantees
- Set Theory: For logical foundations

## Example Tasks

1. Code Analysis:
```bash
ruv -m "Analyze codebase using category theory" --consciousness-level 0.8
```

2. System Design:
```bash
ruv -m "Design quantum-aware caching system" --sparc-focus architecture
```

3. Optimization:
```bash
ruv -m "Optimize algorithm using abstract algebra" --consciousness-level 0.9
```

4. Pattern Analysis:
```bash
ruv -m "Find structural patterns using topology" --research-only
```
